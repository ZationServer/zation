## What is Zation?
Zation is an application server framework which lets you build fast, real-time, secure and scalable backends. 
You can scale it on more CPU cores or machines/instances. 
It's ideal for creating real-time apps, e.g. mobile apps with react-native, multiplayer games or real-time statistic apps. 
The Zation API is providing lots of functions, like a big toolbox and is well structured and documented. 
The complete framework has full typescript and promises support. 
Also, it's easy to use which lets you build big backends very quickly. 
The Zation framework also provides client libraries for communicating to the backend and a library for testing the server. 
Another nice feature of the Zation framework is code error detection. 
This feature will check your code for errors. 
If fatal errors are detected the server won't start for protecting you of an unsafe or faulty backend.

The Zation backend framework is written in Typescript and uses the ÂµWebSockets library which is written in C++. 
So you have to use Typescript or JavaScript to write your backend code. 
For communication to the client, Zation is using the HTTP and WebSocket protocol. 
Zation will offer more than one client driver in different programming languages. 
At the moment there is only one client driver in JavaScript, so you have to write your client in JavaScript.

## Quick Start
```bash
# Install Zation
npm i -g zation
# Create Server Project
zation initServer [folderName]
# Create Client Project
zation initClient [folderName]
```
Your new projects will come with example code, tests, and more.
